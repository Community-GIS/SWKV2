<h1>About Project Swachh Worli Koliwada</h1>

<h2><li>Background</li></h2>
IDFC First Bank in partnership with Stree Mukti Sanghatana and Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai launched project 'Swachh Worli Koliwada' with an aim to create awareness and bring about behavior change about community driven solid waste management practices and segregation at source through a participatory process within the Worli Koliwada community.

The aim of this program is to build a zero waste neighborhood with self-sustainable zones that are equipped to manage solid waste they generate with a model where community participation will be a key at every stage, thereby ensuring sustainability of this program in the long run.
